        I hope something incredible happens to you in the New Year.  
        I want to see you succeed, and I want to watch you crush every single
        goal you've been chasing.

        One thing I'm thankful to this year is it's you. Thank you for coming
        into my life, thank you for the conversations, thank you for everything.
        It’s been 2 months since we got to know each other, and here we are —
        never imagined we would make it this far.
        On this special day, I really want to tell you something.
        I’m a little afraid of how you might react, but yeah!!!
